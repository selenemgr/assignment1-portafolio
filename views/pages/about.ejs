                        <p class=""> I am obsessed with playing videogames🎮, It has been my favorite hobby since I was 2 years old. My first game was Donkey Kong Country for SNES🐒. Currently, my favorite genre to play are Shooters, platforms and MMORPG'S🪅. My favorite game is Nier Automata🤖. Playing videogames help me to relax, enjoy the artistic direction and improve my logical thinking🧩.</p>

                        <p>Since I have discovered different types and styles of clothes👗, I have fallen in love with matching clothes with similar gamma of colors, matching their styles to highlight their features and make beautiful combinations👠. I love to make amusing Outfits every day I go outside, making me feeling pretty and confident about my look💃.</p>

                        <p>Once I learned how to match clothes👒, I found that MakeUp was an important asset to highlight even more the clothes features💄. With MakeUo I can express my artistic side in a way that makes me feel beautiful and I can create even more outfit combinations👙. In addition, while doing my MakeUp I practice my artistic side and improves my painting abilities💍.</p>

                        <p>When I born, my Mom had 2 Rabbits🐇, 4 Parrots🦜, 1 Turtle🐢 and 1 Dog🐶. She gave me my name based on one of her rabit's name. Through all my life I have been surrounded by pets. I had 2 Cat-fish Pets🐠, 2 Rabbits🐇, 5 Baby Chicks🐣 and 1 Dog🐶. I have discovered and I believe that pets are more worthy than most humans, since pets are purely innocence if you give them unconditional love💗, they will always be loyal and will never say or do anything harmful behind your back💖.</p>
