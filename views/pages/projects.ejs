                        <p>This project was intended to demonstrate the creation of an "Image Displayer" with a custom theme. I choose a social videogame called "Club Penguin" that I used to play, in this case the little creatures called "Puffles" change whether some time have passed or a button is pressed. There is also a restart button to show the first image of the list.</p>

                        <p>My first JS web videogame I have created, the main objective is to click on a diamond that is going to change it's position every a few seconds, the more gems you collect, the gem will move faster. There is also two reset buttons to change the score and the speed of the gem. The main purpose of the game is to improve your reaction skills.</p>

The list have a limit of 50 players and is quite sensitive at the time of creating custom players, since all the values are not stricly necessary to create a player, the user can input the values of choice.</p>
